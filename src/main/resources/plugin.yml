    description: >
      Offer a player's previous inventory (stored at the time when they died) to the player to allow them to
      select items to restore.
      Provide a positive integer for the optional second option to see a death other than the most recent one (most recent is 1).
      Set the optional third option to 'true' to see the inventory yourself instead of showing it to the player.
    usage: "Usage: /restoreinventory <player> <inventory number> <see inventory yourself [true|false]>"
